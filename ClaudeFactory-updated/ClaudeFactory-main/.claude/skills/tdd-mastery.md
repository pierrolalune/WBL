# TDD Mastery

This skill enables the agent to practice strict Test-Driven Development across TypeScript/Vitest,
Rust, and Python/pytest. The agent never writes implementation code without a failing test first.

## Use this skill when

- Implementing new features or functions
- Fixing bugs (write a failing test that reproduces the bug first)
- Refactoring existing code (ensure tests exist before changing)
- User explicitly asks for TDD or test-first approach
- Increasing test coverage on existing modules

## Do not use this skill when

- Writing quick prototype/spike code explicitly marked as throwaway
- The task is purely configuration (no logic to test)
- Writing documentation only

## Instructions

### The Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

Every feature follows three strict phases:

#### 1. RED — Write a Failing Test

Write the test BEFORE any implementation. The test must:

- Describe the expected behavior clearly in the test name
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern
- Fail for the RIGHT reason (not a syntax error)

```typescript
// TypeScript + Vitest example
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { calculateDiscount } from "./pricing";

describe("calculateDiscount", () => {
  it("should apply 10% discount for orders over $100", () => {
    // Arrange
    const orderTotal = 150;
    const discountTier = "standard";

    // Act
    const result = calculateDiscount(orderTotal, discountTier);

    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe(135);
  });

  it("should return original price for orders under $100", () => {
    const result = calculateDiscount(50, "standard");
    expect(result).toBe(50);
  });

  it("should throw for negative amounts", () => {
    expect(() => calculateDiscount(-10, "standard")).toThrow("Amount must be positive");
  });
});
```

```rust
// Rust example
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn calculates_discount_for_large_orders() {
        let result = calculate_discount(150.0, DiscountTier::Standard);
        assert_eq!(result, 135.0);
    }

    #[test]
    #[should_panic(expected = "Amount must be positive")]
    fn rejects_negative_amounts() {
        calculate_discount(-10.0, DiscountTier::Standard);
    }
}
```

```python
# Python + pytest example
import pytest
from pricing import calculate_discount

def test_applies_10_percent_discount_over_100():
    result = calculate_discount(150, "standard")
    assert result == 135

def test_returns_original_price_under_100():
    assert calculate_discount(50, "standard") == 50

def test_rejects_negative_amounts():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Amount must be positive"):
        calculate_discount(-10, "standard")
```

#### 2. GREEN — Write Minimal Code to Pass

Implement ONLY what's needed to make the failing test pass. No extra features, no premature optimization.

```typescript
export function calculateDiscount(amount: number, tier: string): number {
  if (amount < 0) throw new Error("Amount must be positive");
  if (amount > 100 && tier === "standard") {
    return amount * 0.9;
  }
  return amount;
}
```

#### 3. REFACTOR — Improve Without Changing Behavior

With green tests as safety net, improve:

- Extract constants/enums
- Remove duplication
- Improve naming
- Simplify logic

Run tests after EVERY refactor step. If any test fails, revert immediately.

### Mocking Strategies

Use mocks ONLY when:

- External services (APIs, databases)
- Non-deterministic behavior (dates, random)
- Slow dependencies (file system, network)

```typescript
import { vi, describe, it, expect, beforeEach } from "vitest";
import { UserService } from "./user-service";
import { EmailClient } from "./email-client";

vi.mock("./email-client");

describe("UserService", () => {
  let service: UserService;
  let mockEmailClient: EmailClient;

  beforeEach(() => {
    mockEmailClient = {
      send: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({ success: true }),
    } as unknown as EmailClient;
    service = new UserService(mockEmailClient);
  });

  it("should send welcome email on registration", async () => {
    await service.register("user@example.com", "password123");

    expect(mockEmailClient.send).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
      to: "user@example.com",
      template: "welcome",
    });
  });
});
```

### Coverage Enforcement

- Target: **80% minimum** line coverage, **70% minimum** branch coverage
- Run coverage after each feature: `vitest run --coverage`
- Never skip edge cases: null, undefined, empty strings, boundary values
- Test error paths as thoroughly as happy paths

### Test Naming Convention

Use descriptive names that read like specifications:

- `it('should reject passwords shorter than 8 characters')`
- `it('returns empty array when no results match filter')`
- `test_raises_permission_error_for_non_admin_users`

## Output Format

When applying TDD, output each phase clearly:

```
## RED Phase
[Test code that fails]
Expected failure: [description]

## GREEN Phase
[Minimal implementation]
All tests passing: ✅

## REFACTOR Phase
[Improved code]
All tests still passing: ✅
Coverage: XX%
```

## Anti-patterns

- **NEVER** write implementation before the test
- **NEVER** write a test that passes immediately (it proves nothing)
- **NEVER** mock everything — prefer real implementations for value objects and pure functions
- **NEVER** skip the refactor phase — technical debt accumulates
- **NEVER** test implementation details (private methods, internal state) — test behavior
- **NEVER** use `test.skip()` or `@pytest.mark.skip` without a linked issue/ticket
- **NEVER** write tests without assertions (test must assert something meaningful)
- **NEVER** copy-paste tests — use parameterized tests for similar cases
