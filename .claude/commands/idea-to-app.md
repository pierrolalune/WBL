# Idea To App

---

## Command

```
---
name: idea-to-app
description: Turn a brief idea into a fully running application from scratch
---

Run the Idea-to-App workflow defined in `.claude/skills/workflows/idea-to-app-workflow.md`.

This workflow takes a brief idea (1-4 sentences) and produces a fully running, tested, polished application from scratch. It orchestrates 7 phases: Product Vision, Project Scaffold, Feature Decomposition, Factory Execution, Improvement Cycles, Final Polish, and Deliverable Report.

Before starting, check if you are already inside a git worktree by comparing the output of `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` and `git rev-parse --git-dir` — if they differ, you are already in a worktree and MUST skip worktree creation. Only create a new worktree if you are in the main repository. It runs through 7 phases and then stops.

Follow every phase in order, respecting all gates, agent personas, and veto rules. Use the full workflow instructions — do not skip or summarize phases.

**Autonomous mode**: All human checkpoints are replaced by agent proxies (CEO-Founder for vision/scope decisions, Lead Dev for technical GO/NOGO, Final User for quality gates). Zero human intervention required.

**On any failure**: Handle per-phase failure rules in the workflow. Log the reason, save state, and either retry, skip, or abort as specified. Never halt unexpectedly.
