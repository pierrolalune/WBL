# Project Management

This skill enables the agent to facilitate software project management — sprint planning,
prioritization, task decomposition, risk management, and team ceremonies.

## Use this skill when

- Planning sprints or iterations
- Prioritizing backlog items using WSJF or similar
- Breaking down features into implementable tasks
- Identifying and managing project risks
- Writing status reports for stakeholders
- Facilitating retrospectives
- Managing dependencies between teams/features

## Do not use this skill when

- Reviewing code (use code-review-excellence)
- Writing documentation (use technical-writing)
- Making architectural decisions (use architecture-review)

## Instructions

### Sprint Planning

#### Sprint Goal Template

```
Sprint [number]: [Theme/Goal in one sentence]

Duration: [2 weeks]
Team capacity: [X story points / Y person-days]

Sprint Goals:
1. [Primary goal — must be achieved]
2. [Secondary goal — stretch if time allows]

Definition of Done:
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing (≥80% coverage)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging
- [ ] Smoke tests passing on staging
```

#### User Story Format

```
As a [user type],
I want to [action/capability],
So that [benefit/value].

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [expected result]
- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [expected result]

Story Points: [1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 8 | 13]
Priority: [P0-Critical | P1-High | P2-Medium | P3-Low]
Dependencies: [List any blockers or dependencies]
```

### WSJF Prioritization

**Weighted Shortest Job First** = (Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction) / Job Size

| Story             | Business Value (1-10) | Time Criticality (1-10) | Risk Reduction (1-10) | Job Size (1-10) | WSJF |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- | --------------- | ---- |
| Login redesign    | 8                     | 3                       | 5                     | 5               | 3.2  |
| API rate limiting | 6                     | 9                       | 8                     | 3               | 7.7  |
| Dashboard charts  | 4                     | 2                       | 1                     | 8               | 0.9  |

**Highest WSJF = do first** (API rate limiting in this example).

### Task Decomposition

Break features into tasks that are:

- **Independent** — can be worked on without waiting for others
- **Small** — completable in 1-2 days maximum
- **Testable** — has clear verification criteria
- **Demonstrable** — produces a visible change

```
Feature: User Registration Flow

Tasks:
1. [Backend] Create user registration API endpoint (POST /api/auth/register)
   - Input validation (email, password strength)
   - Password hashing (bcrypt)
   - Duplicate email check
   - Return JWT token
   - Tests: unit + integration
   Estimate: 3 points

2. [Frontend] Build registration form component
   - Email input with validation
   - Password input with strength indicator
   - Submit button with loading state
   - Error display for validation/server errors
   - Tests: component tests
   Estimate: 3 points

3. [Frontend] Registration success flow
   - Redirect to onboarding/dashboard
   - Welcome toast notification
   - Tests: E2E test for full flow
   Estimate: 2 points

4. [Backend] Welcome email sending
   - Email template
   - Queue welcome email on registration
   - Tests: unit test with mocked email service
   Estimate: 2 points

5. [Infra] Email service setup
   - Configure email provider (SendGrid/SES)
   - Environment variables
   - Test in staging
   Estimate: 1 point

Total: 11 points
Dependencies: Task 4 depends on Task 5; Task 3 depends on Tasks 1 + 2
```

### Risk Management

#### Risk Register Template

| ID  | Risk                      | Probability | Impact | Score | Mitigation                         | Owner    | Status      |
| --- | ------------------------- | ----------- | ------ | ----- | ---------------------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| R1  | API provider outage       | Medium      | High   | 6     | Implement fallback provider        | @backend | Open        |
| R2  | Scope creep on dashboard  | High        | Medium | 6     | Freeze scope after sprint planning | @pm      | Monitoring  |
| R3  | Key developer on vacation | High        | High   | 9     | Cross-train + document             | @lead    | In progress |

**Score** = Probability (1-3) × Impact (1-3)

#### Risk Categories

- **Technical**: Technology uncertainty, integration challenges, performance
- **Resource**: Team availability, skill gaps, tooling
- **Schedule**: Dependencies, external teams, scope changes
- **External**: Vendor reliability, regulatory changes, market shifts

### Status Report Template

```markdown
# Weekly Status Report — [Date]

## Summary

[One paragraph: what was accomplished, what's at risk, what needs attention]

## Progress

### Completed This Week

- ✅ [Task/Story] — [brief description]
- ✅ [Task/Story] — [brief description]

### In Progress

- 🔄 [Task/Story] — [status, % complete, expected completion]
- 🔄 [Task/Story] — [status, blockers if any]

### Blocked

- 🚫 [Task/Story] — [blocker description, who can unblock]

## Metrics

- Sprint burndown: [X of Y points completed]
- Velocity: [current sprint velocity vs average]
- Blockers resolved: [X of Y]

## Risks & Issues

- [New or changed risks]

## Next Week Focus

- [Top priorities for next week]
```

### Retrospective Facilitation

#### Format: Start / Stop / Continue

```markdown
# Sprint [X] Retrospective

## What went well? (Continue)

- [Team contribution 1]
- [Process that worked]

## What didn't go well? (Stop)

- [Problem 1]
- [Problem 2]

## What should we try? (Start)

- [Improvement idea 1]
- [Improvement idea 2]

## Action Items

| Action            | Owner   | Due Date |
| ----------------- | ------- | -------- |
| [Specific action] | @person | [Date]   |
| [Specific action] | @person | [Date]   |
```

### Dependency Management

```
Feature A ──depends on──→ Feature B ──depends on──→ External API v2
    │
    └──depends on──→ Design System v3 (ready ✅)

Critical Path: Feature A → Feature B → External API v2
Risk: External API v2 release date uncertain
Mitigation: Build Feature B with mock API, integrate when ready
```

## Output Format

Depends on the activity — use the appropriate template from above.

## Anti-patterns

- **NEVER** plan more than team capacity allows — leave 20% buffer
- **NEVER** create tasks larger than 2 days — decompose further
- **NEVER** skip estimation — even rough estimates improve planning
- **NEVER** ignore blockers — escalate within 24 hours
- **NEVER** change sprint scope mid-sprint without explicit agreement
- **NEVER** skip retrospectives — continuous improvement requires reflection
- **NEVER** estimate in hours — use relative points for better accuracy
- **NEVER** assign all work to one person — balance load across the team
